# DDOS-Denier

DDOS-Denier is a tool designed to evaluate incoming server attacks based on CPU load and automatically take countermeasures. Specifically tailored for Cloudflare websites, it seamlessly activates Cloudflare Under Attack Mode (UAM - DNS) during heavy CPU loads and deactivates it once the attack subsides.
